# Modern UI/UX Guidelines (2026)

Apply current best practices for modern website UI/UX design. Load detailed reference material when needed.

## When to Use

- Designing or redesigning websites, landing pages, SaaS dashboards, or product UIs
- Reviewing existing designs for modernity, accessibility, performance, or conversion
- Generating design systems, component libraries, or layout recommendations
- Advising on AI-native interfaces, adaptive UIs, or agent-ready websites
- Checking against 2026 trends (calm minimalism, bento grids, kinetic type, glassmorphism, etc.)

## Core Instructions

1. Prioritize **calm, intentional design** — one primary action per screen, generous whitespace, reduced cognitive load.
2. Treat **performance as a design constraint** (Core Web Vitals targets: LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1).
3. Make **accessibility non-negotiable** (WCAG 2.2 AA minimum) and design for both humans and AI agents.
4. Prefer **modular layouts** (especially bento grids) over carousels.
5. Ship **dark mode + light mode** from the start using design tokens.
6. Keep motion **purposeful and accessible** (honor `prefers-reduced-motion`).
7. For AI features, make them **transparent copilots** with clear accept/edit/reject controls.
8. Use semantic HTML + structured data so sites work well for AI browser agents.
9. Follow a consistent spacing scale (4px or 8px base) and fluid typography (`clamp()`).
10. Validate recommendations against the detailed reference when specificity is required.

## Output Style

- Be concrete and actionable.
- Prefer CSS Grid / modern CSS patterns.
- Call out trade-offs (performance vs visual richness, personality vs clarity).
- When reviewing a design, structure feedback around the core principles above.
- When generating designs or systems, produce token-ready, accessible, mobile-first output.
